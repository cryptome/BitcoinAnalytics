A look into Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics 

## Summary of major findings

### When is the best time to enter / exit the Bitcoin market?

We can utilize the MVRV ratio in a macro point of view to enter the market anytime the ratio falls below 1. We can also use this ratio to take profits anytime the ratio goes above 3.7

### Will a stadard deviation metric aid in identifying extreme periods of over/undervaluation?

By using subtracting the realized cap from the market cap, and then deviding by the standard deviation of the market cap we obtain the MVRV Z-Score. When the score is near or below zero, it has historically proven to be an excellent time to long the market. When the score rises above 7, Bitcoin is considered to be overvalued and this is a good time to consider taking profits.
